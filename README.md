## 1.0. Business Problem

Airbnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging to tourism activities. Airbnb does not own 
any of the listed properties, instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. 

New users on Airbnb can book a place across over 190 countries. By accurately predicting where a new user will book their
first travel experience, Airbnb can share more personalized content with their community, decrease the average time to 
first booking, and better forecast demand. 

For this project, company provide a dataset of users from the USA and are asked to predict which country a new user's
first booking destination will be. There are 12 possible outcomes of the destination country: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 
'IT', 'PT', 'NL', 'DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found) and 'others'.

## 2.0. Business Assumptions

For this project a few assumptions were made to solve the problem:
- Due to the granularity desired for the prediction, the session dataset will not be consdiered.
- A user can choose only one country destination.
- Users older than 100 will not be considered.
